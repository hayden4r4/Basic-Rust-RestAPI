# Rust RestAPI w/ Rocket & Postgres DB  
  
This is a very basic RestAPI using Rust and the Rocket web framework.  Postgres is used for the database.  Both GET and POST requests are available in JSON format.  This is my first rust project and is mainly designed to learn the language as well as getting familiar with building RestAPI's.
